We rely on data from the performance management system of a case firm to investigate the effect of narrative feedback (NF) on performance. NF is widely used and represents contextual and constituting information regarding performance that goes beyond informing the feedback receiver of results via ratings or rankings. Differences in level of detail, causal explanations, and the sentiment contained in NF are likely to aid or inhibit performance improvements. Based on archival data from the case firm, we show that, on average, the level of detail in praise and the level of causal language use in criticism both increase the likelihood of performance improvements. We find no overall effect of NF sentiment, but find a negative effect of positive sentiment in praise on the likelihood of performance improvement for low performers. Our findings contribute to the feedback literature by showing which aspects of NF the receivers of feedback respond to and how.
